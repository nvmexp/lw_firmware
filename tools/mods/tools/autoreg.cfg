# Configuration File
#
# NUM_CLIENTS = Number of client machines.
#
# 
# CLIENT_COMMAND_LINE = The mods command line specifying all switches,
#                       etc. that the client should use (except for
#                       the switch determining the name of the log file;
#                       the client takes care of that itself).
#                       Note that this shouldn't include mods.exe itself,
#                       but should include the .js file to run.
#                       For example:
#               CLIENT_COMMAND_LINE = mfgtest.js -gpu -agp2x
#
#
# RECIPIENT_LIST = Comma-separated list of email addresses that should get the
#                  daily report.
#
# MAIL_SENDER = lwpu username to use as the sender of the report.
