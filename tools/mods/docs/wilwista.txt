Instructions for building and running MODS under Vista
-----------------------------------------

MODS is now supporting Windows Vista operating system. Here is a short 
introduction.

0. Prepare files you need:
 
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/diag/cpp/...  
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/diag/encrypt/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/diag/js/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/diag/mods/...

 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/*.lwmk
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/cglang/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/ddraw/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/common/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/display/*.lwmk
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/display/lddm/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/display/winnt4/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/modeset/timing/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/OpenGL/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/resman/*
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/resman/arch/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/resman/config/...
 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers/resman/kernel/...

 //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/sdk/...


1. Make Vista Display Driver.
   Current version is under //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/drivers 
   
   a) Set environment variables: 
		LW_SOURCE        = C:\src\dev\gpu_drv\chips_a
		LW_TOOLS         = C:\src\sw\tools
		LW_INSTALL_DIR   = C:\mods\src\drv
		PATH             = C:\src\sw\tools\win32\MiscBuildTools
		LW_BUILD_TYPE    = release

   b) Make (C:\src\sw\dev\gpu_drv\chips_a\drivers\common\build) :
		lwmake clean
		lwmake lddm display 

   Alternatively take already made one from
   \\builds\Nightly\LW\Wilwista\00_LastKnownGood-CHIPS_A


2. Copy driver files and reload the driver.
   (assume that you have already installed common LWPU Vista Display Driver)

   a) LW_INSTALL_DIR\lwd3dum.dll    ->  %windir%\system32\lwd3dum.dll
      LW_INSTALL_DIR\lwlddmkm.sys   ->  %windir%\system32\drivers\lwlddmkm.sys
      
   b) Computer -> Manage -> Device Manager -> Display Adapters -> Lwpu Device
       -> Disable [Enable]   

   
3. Build MODS.
   a) Set environment variable important for Vista mode: 
		BUILD_OS=wilwista

   (more information on how to build MODS you find 
    //sw/dev/gpu_drv/chips_a/diag/mods/docs/build.txt )

		
4. Run MODS with Admin rights. This is VERY important, otherwise MODS will not be
   able to reload the Display Driver.
   


Miscellaneous (especially for remote debug)
-----------------------------------------

You will find Vista working much more better if you disable USER ACCOUNT CONTROL.
Follow instructions given at https://engwiki/index.php/Vista  
(Disabling User Account Control (UAC)).

Turn off the firewall: Control Panel -> Windows Firewall -> Change settings 
 -> Off

For information on setting up the kernel debugger, boot menus and BCDEDIT see the
Debugging Tips section at https://engwiki/index.php/Windows_Vista/Debugging
