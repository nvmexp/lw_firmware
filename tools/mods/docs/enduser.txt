How to build an End-User MODS.

1) Build DOS MODS normally (see build.txt).

2) Copy the extra script file .../mods/gpu/js/enduser.js into your runspace.

3) You will need to use encrypt.exe. You can build it by using its makefile
inside <branch>/diag/encrypt if you do not already have it.
Go to your runspace folder and type:

<path-to-your-encrypt-app>\encrypt.exe -b enduser.js boundjs.h

4) Copy the file boundjs.h into .../mods/djgpp.

5) Rebuild MODS with the environment variables BOUND_JS=gpu/js/enduser.js.
Make sure you either do a clean build, or at least rebuild core/include/version.h
and the .cpp files that #include it.

6) The entire release package is just the mods.exe.  No golden files or
.js scripts are included -- they are all either generated at runtime or
are compiled into the exelwtable.
