LWPU MODS, MOdular Diagnostic Software, allows users to test LWPU
hardware.

Package contents
================

The MODS package contains the following files:
    README                  This file
    mods                    MODS exelwtable
    install_module.sh       Installation script for the MODS kernel module
    mods_kernel_driver.tgz  Source code of the MODS kernel module
    default.bin             LWPU logo image
    lrf.bin                 Test file
    grf.bin                 Test file

Usage
=====

Usage:
    % ./mods [options]

Options:
    -v                  Displays version information and exits.
    -notest             Displays system configuration and does not perform
                        any testing.
    -dev N              Runs MODS on the selected device (N is zero-based
                        index).
    -poll_interrupts    Troubleshooting option when the OS is unable to hook
                        interrupts.
    -blink_lights       Blinks keyboard lights when tests are running.

Any other options are ignored.

MODS kernel module
==================

MODS comes with a kernel module which is needed to communicate directly with
the hardware. The kernel module needs to be built the first time MODS is run,
therefore the system must have Linux kernel headers installed.

When MODS is ran with root privileges, it will automatically build and insert
the kernel module if it finds out that the kernel module is not installed.

If MODS is ran from an ordinary user account, the kernel module has to be
pre-installed by the root user with the install_module.sh script which comes
with MODS. After the kernel module is loaded, it publishes a device node
/dev/mods. The user who runs MODS must have sufficient access rights to be
able to access this device. The access rights to the kernel module can be
altered in udev rules file, typically /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mods.rules.

When the kernel module is installed with the install_module.sh script, it will
still not be automatically loaded on boot. Either the root user must execute
`modprobe mods' or the MODS module must be placed in a distribution-dependent
file which lists auto-loaded modules, for example in /etc/modules (Debian) or
/etc/conf.d/modules (Gentoo).

Tests performed by MODS
=======================

MODS performs several tests during a run:
 * MatsTest (test 3)        CPU-bound memory test.
 * Random2d (test 58)       2D graphics test.
 * GLRandomTest (test 16)   OpenGL test.
 * LwdaMatsTest (test 87)   LWCA-based memory test.
 * LwdaGrfTest (test 89)    LWCA shared memory test.
 * CheckPCIExpressBus       background test which counts errors on the PCI
                            Express bus during other tests' exelwtion.

Some tests (such as test 58 or test 16) run twice to verify that their results
are stable and consistent.

The background CheckPCIExpressBus test sometimes reports "Pcie error
detected". These are the correctible errors allowed by the PCI Express
specification. If the number of the correctible errors grows above a certain
threshold, the test will fail and notify about it. The test also detects
non-correctible errors and fails if there are any.
