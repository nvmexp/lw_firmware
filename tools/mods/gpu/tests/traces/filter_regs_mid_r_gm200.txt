# LW_PCE_* are not real registers.The "LW_PCE_*" symbols (no engine number) are
# just offsets, and are used when software wants to have a single routine that
# can address all of the CEs, by adding in different base addresses. These 
# should never be used directly as registers, as they will alias off into host
# somewhere. So the values reported there are just gibberish.
