# This file contains register symbols used by externally-released
# Javascript files.

# Please do not add a new register to this file unless necessary.
# The long-term goal is to protect IP by removing all register reads &
# writes from JS code, since a competent hacker can extract the
# register names from any interface that uses named registers.
# Instead, put the register reads/writes in C++ code that is called
# from JS.
