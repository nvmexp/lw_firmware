TODO List for Mac OSX port
--------------------------

- //sw/main/drivers/resman/arch/lwalloc/mods/src/rmmacosx.cpp:
  RmFindDevices is lwrrently not very robust.  See the file for details.

- Xp::DisableUserInterface and Xp::EnableUserInterface are far from
  perfect.  I've had great diffilwlty in finding a way to save the
  original DM settings in DisableUserInterface and then restore those
  settings in EnableUserInterface.

- Apparently, calls to the OS function Debugger() do nothing except
  print out "Debugger() was called!"  We'd like this to shunt us out
  to the actual debugger, of course.

- Keymapping is very screwy, since OSX, unlike DOS, is sending
  multi-character escape sequences for some special keys and
  key combinations (like alt-f1), and nothing is getting to
  getchar() at all for other sequences (like alt-f10).

- In the makefile, INCLUDE_OGL is lwrrently turned off for the
  OSX build.  OpenGL support hasn't been touched yet.
