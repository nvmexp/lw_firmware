Shared scripts and related files for ucode builds

    scripts/...
        rtos-flcn-script.pl -- general script to help RTOS Flcn on build process:
                               . generate the header file for common profile defines
                               . generate the header file for OSTASK defines
                               . ilwoke overlay size check script
                               input files include: Profiles.pm, Tasks.pm...

        GenRmProp.pm        -- shared part of genRmProp.pl script.  Generate RM
                               Properties base on profile features (Features.pm).
                               The output files include:
                                 RESMAN_ROOT\kernel\inc\pmu\bin\g_pmuUcodePdb.h
                                 RESMAN_ROOT\kernel\inc\pmu\bin\g_pmuSetUcodeProp.c

        rmPdbAutoGen.pl     -- colwert ucode features (Features.pm) to RM PDBs
                               in generated file.  The design of this script doesn't
                               support multiple profiles on single chip.

        symdump/symdump.pl  -- generate symbol information for lwwatch extension

        check-build-elw.pl  -- [TBD]

        release-imgs-if-changed.pl
                            -- script to output files to a release path
                               Does p4 add or p4 edit as needed in order to avoid
                               making changes that aren't tracked in perforce.

        manifestGenerator.pl
                            -- script to generate manifest files for an engine's
                               bindata directory. Should be called at the end of
                               every ucode build that uses lwArchive.

        riscv-stats-gen.pl
                            -- script to analyze a RISCV build, and generate a
                               text file describing the memory usage of each section
                               within the program, and overall memory usage.

        nm-file-sort.pl
                            -- script to sort a .nm file first by symbol value/address
                               and then by rest of the text. This is needed since GNU nm
                               can sort by address or by symbol name but not both at once,
                               and we sometimes get different orderings for symbols with
                               the same value/address but a different name, which causes
                               a spurious "only symbols changed" release (for example on
                               RISCV builds on Linux vs Windows). This script can be used
                               to prevent that scenario.

        rvmkimg.pl             script to create Riscv ucode image files

        ReadElf.pm
        SimpleLogger.pm
        Table.pm            -- Library scripts used to support the operations of

    scripts/analyze/...
        UcodeAnalyze.pm     -- script to check for stack overflows and broken
                               overlay rules by analyzing objdump

        Output.pm           -- module for all of UcodeAnalyze's output files

    mcheck/...              -- shared mcheck modules for flcn ucodes.
                               check mcheck wiki for details.
        FlcnMcheck.pm       -- child module of Mcheck.pm
        FlcnMethodTagDb.pm  -- child module of MethodTagDb.pm
        FlcnLwolwtility.pm  -- module to query halinfo of ucode access function from LWOC

Per module data files (Profiles.pm, Tasks.pm...) are located at 'build' dir of
each ucode build.  For details, please refer to:
