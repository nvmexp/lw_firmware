# Task Debugging

It's critical to support Task and Kernel level debugging to support
our RTOS clients.

While this solution requires a Kernel Server, it should not require
tight coupling to the core scheduler, MM, or other components.

The initial solution will support debugging the LIBOS kernel services
(such as the memory manager and transparent messaging).  Later
implementations may suppor full kernel debugging.

## Motivating Requirements

P0. Must support debugging code mapped RO in PMP
P1. Should support kernel debugging
P1. Should support memory breakpoints
P2. Footprint of debugger stub should be minimal
P2. Should support software breakpoints
    (This requires RW IOPMP or RW PMP mappings for code.
     We should not rely on this for production debug in Blackwell.)

There are many more requirements, but these are the ones
that drive the hardware requirements.

## Summary of Hardware Requirement

P0. Configurable Trigger Unit ownership [HWICD vs SW Debugger]
P0. Dedicated interrupt bit and scratch register for debugger
P0. Trigger interrupt should have defined priority relative to other
    events such as Timer and Page Fault.

## Major Components

A debugger is composed of three major components.  

- Communication
- Single Step Engine
- Trigger Unit (hardware breakpoints)

## Component. Single Step Engine

Reliable single step engines are a challenging problem for HW.

Processor errata with stepping over certain classes of instructions
is common.  For instance, early Opterons would branch to a nearly
random address if you did single-step in kernel mode over a specific
unusual load instruction.  Our own peregrines will step over a block
of CSRs as well. 

Most importantly, we cannot single step in S-mode for an in-kernel
debugger.  This is due to the design that single-step exceptions
for S-mode must be handled in M-mode.

Based on these challenges, a software design is the safest solution.

def SingleStep():
    -- Decode instruction using libriscv.c
    if branch instruction:
        Set trigger on target PC
    Set trigger on next PC
    Run()

## Component. Trigger Unit

Peregrine already has a trigger unit for the ICD.

We're proposing adding a global machine mode CSR to configure
the owner of the Trigger unit to either HWICD, or Supervisor.

Case 0. HWICD is off by default
    - SK would configure Trigger.Owner = Supervisor
    
Case 1. HWICD is enabled by default
    - LIBOS would call SK to disable the HWICD and set Trigger.Owner = Supervisor

Requirements:
    - Fast mass disable / clear for SK seperation kernel switch
    - At least 8 triggers
    - Each trigger is a NAPOT page with bits for R, W, X
    - Hitting the trigger generates a unique supervisor mode interrupt
    - Memory breakpoint
    - Exelwtion breakpoint

### Define Priority for Trigger

We need a clear specification of what happens when a single
instruction has multiple events.

#### Priority(Trigger) > Priority(PageFault)
For instance, if I hit a trigger on a store instruction that
is about to access a bad MPU page, we should document that
trigger takes priority.

#### Priority(Trigger) < Priority(Timer)

Similarly, if I trigger on an instruction at the same time as
as a timer interrupt, the timer interrupt should take precedence.

Failure to do so could lead to a task never being context
switched away from during repeated single-steps.  

## Component. Communication

We build a synchronous RPC model built on top of a single CPU->Peregrine interrupt and 
the DEBUGINFO register.  The CPU is the initiator and controls when Send and Recv operations
start and stop.  CPU can wait for events from the peregrine side through the WaitForEvent
signal (this state is cancelable through an interrupt).

### Messages

Remember: All messages are from CPU->Peregrine

Capabilities()
    Requests information on the debugger stub running on Peregrine.

Tasks()
    Returns the list of tasks lwrrently running by task-id.

TaskAttach()
    Attaches the debugger to the task.  We'll hold a reference
    count on the task object to prevent the Task object
    from being destroyed.

TaskSubscribe(EventMask)
    Control which events from the task we care about.
    EventMask = {EventBreakpoint, EventTaskSpawn, EventTaskExit, EventDebugPrint, ..}

TaskDetach()
    Clears any subscriptions and detaches from the task.
    Reference count will be dropped.

TaskReadVirtualMemory(TaskId, VirtualAddress, size, buffer)
    Reads memory from a task.

TaskWriteVirtualMemory(TaskId, VirtualAddress, size, buffer)
    Write memory from a task.

BreakpointSet(TaskId, Slot, Address, size, R|W|X)
    Sets a breakpoint on the Peregrine.

BreakpointClear(TaskId, Slot)

TaskStateGet()
    Returns the current state of the task (e.g. LibosTaskState)
    Includes: GPRs, running/stopped, fault reason, etc.

TaskStateSet()
    Overwrites the LibosTaskState with the provided state.
    Allows changing any GPR.

Run(TaskId)
    Returns a task to the running state.
    Note: If the task crashes due to an invalid pointer access,
          breakpoint, ebreak, etc this will re-issue the faulting
          instruction.

Stop(TaskId)
    Stops a running task. 

Step(TaskId)
    Single steps a running task. 

AsyncGetEvent()
    Informs peregrine we're ready for the next event

PollEvent(out EventMask)
    CPU periodically calls this to see if the previously issued 
    AsyncGetEvent() is complete.

    EventMask = {EventBreakpoint, EventTaskSpawn, EventTaskExit, EventDebugPrint, ..}

CancelGetEvent()
    Cancels the last get event to the peregrine.  
    @note: We raise an interrupt to the Peregrine and wait for the ACK.
           This returns the bus to CPU control.


                  

### Message Passing Protocol
The expectation is that the CPU will poll and the peregrine will response through interrupts.
This is based on the assumption that the client is LWWATCH.

Send(payload, size):
    Sends a message from the CPU to the debugger.
    Breaks large messages into 3 byte chunks
    for transmisison over the DEBUGINFO register.

    31     29  25  24  23                       0
    ---------------------------------------------
    |  State |  Size |       Payload             |
    ---------------------------------------------


    Example:
        Send({0x01,0x02,x03,0x04,0x05,0x06}, 6)
        Precondition: DEBUGINFO.State = Ack
        CPU: writes DEBUGINFO as {header:{State=Send, Size=3}, , 0x01, 0x02, 0x03}
        CPU: raises interrupt to peregrine
        CPU: waits for Peregrine to set DEBUGIFO to {header: {State=Ack}}
        CPU: writes DEBUGINFO as {header: State={SendComplete,Size=3}, Sequence=0, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03}
        CPU: raises interrupt to peregrine
        CPU: waits for Peregrine to set DEBUGIFO to {header: {State=Ack}}

Recv(payload, size):
    Notifies the Peregrine we're ready to accept the reply data from the last Send.
        Precondition: DEBUGINFO.State = Ack
        CPU: writes DEBUGINFO as {header:{State=Recv, Size=3}}
        CPU: raises interrupt to peregrine
        CPU: waits for Peregrine to set DEBUGIFO to {header: {State=RecvReply, Size =3}, {0x01, 0x02, 0x03}}
        CPU: writes DEBUGINFO as {header:{State=RecvContinue, Size=3}}
        CPU: raises interrupt to peregrine
        CPU: waits for Peregrine to set DEBUGIFO to {header: {State=Ack, Size =3}, {0x04, 0x05, 0x06}}

WaitForEvent():
    Notifies the peregrine that we're waiting for an event from them.  The Peregrine
    will not ack until an event is ready.

        Precondition: DEBUGINFO.State = Ack

    Case 0. We want for an event (like hitting a breakpoint)
        CPU: writes DEBUGINFO as {header:{State=WaitForEvent}}
        ...
        an event is triggered on Peregrine
        ..
        CPU: waits for DEBUGINFO to read {header:{State=Ack}}
        

    Case 1. We wait for an event, but then cancel.
        CPU: writes DEBUGINFO as {header:{State=WaitForEvent}}
        ...
        no event triggered, but CPU needs to cancel to send another mesage
        ...
        CPU: Raises interrupt to Peregrine
        CPU: Waits for state = {header:{State=EventTriggered}}
        

Packet State:
    Send              - CPU is streaming data to the peregrine.                
    SendComplete      - This is the last packet of the send.
    Ack               - Peregrine is returning control of the bus to 
                        the CPU.  This may contain the final payload.
    Recv              - CPU is requesting data from the peregrine
    RecvReply         - Peregrine is replying to Recv with data
