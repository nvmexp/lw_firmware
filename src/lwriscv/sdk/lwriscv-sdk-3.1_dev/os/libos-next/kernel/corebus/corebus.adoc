# Core Bus

Provides asynchronous message delivery between cores and partitions.

Definitions:
   LIBOS Partition - This is a virtual machine selwred by the Separation Kernel and LIBOS Root partition (ADA SPARK)
                     Each partition corresponds to a separate copy of a the LIBOS kernel, tasks, etc.
                     The operating system is paravirtualized.

   Seperation Kernel - Firmware running in machine mode reponsible for spatial isolation between partitions.
                       Each core runs a seperate instance.  Instances do not communicate or share memory
	               except to handle secure message page allocation and transfer.

   Task Group        - A collection of tasks visibile as a single scheduling entity to the distribution global scheduling algorithm.
                       A single task group will be running on a given core at a given time.
		       Each task group belongs to a specific partition, so multiple partitions might be active on different cores at 
		       the same time.


## Secure Partition Messaging

The SK mantains a collection of up to 64 4kb pages for secure messaging.
A partition may allocate one or more of these pages, fill them out, and then 
selwrely transfer ownership of them to another partition.

A single page may be mapped into a given partition at a time.

### Algorithm

openPages = []
def PartitionSendMessage(targetPartiton, message)
    if targetPartition in openPages:
        append message to existing page
        return
    if no free pages from SK
        find partitition with most pages assigned to it
	switch to partition to handle messages and switch back
    allocate page 
    add page to openPages
    append message to page		

def LeaveLwrrentPartition():
    Transfer all open pages to target partitions


## SMP SK Model

Each core runs a seperate SK instance initialized from the same manifest
 - PMP setting are core local
 - Partition switching is core local

The only co-operation between SK instances on cores in the core bus.
 - Secure pages for messaging cannot be core local
   \-> SK instances must have some shared TCM to negotiate ownership
       of these shared pages.  To do otherwise completely breaks our 
       messaging model.

## Intra-Partition Inter-Core Messaging

Messages between Processor cores running the same partition belong to the same LIBOS instance.
The kernel keeps a collection of pages for this purpose.

Interrupts are used to wake up the cores.
