# Security Strategies

### OVERFLOW-ADD-1. Alternate inclusive range traversal  

Never use a plain for loop to iterate with a stride greater than one.
Inclusive range traversals are possible that avoid the explicit
__builtin_add_overflow check, however this is the simplest construction
to read.

```
while (first <= last)
{
    KernelPrintf("hit: %llx", first);

    if (__builtin_add_overflow(first, LIBOS_CONFIG_PAGESIZE, &first))
        break;
}
```
