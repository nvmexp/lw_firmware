# Real-time Kernel

## Core Requirements

- No tasks with priority weaker than lwrrently exelwtion task 
  may run.
- No timers with priority weaker than lwrrently exelwting task
  may run.
- All scheduling operations must be lg time.
- Scheduler must be deterministic

## Realtime Timer subsystem

The timer subsystem may not examine timers with weaker priority
than any ready or running task.  

Timers should be tracked using a augmented binary tree.
The tree should be sorted by timeout. Each node should be augmented with the 
strongest priority timer in the subtree as well as the highest timeout in subtree.

Node::
    // Normal binary tree data
    Link  left, right, parent;
    LwU64 timeout;
    
    // Augmented subtree
    LwU64 lowestPriorityInSubtree;
    LwU64 biggestTimeoutInSubtree;

Search algorithm::
  1. Find all subtrees that are fully elapsed 
     There will be at most lg(N) such trees
  2. Pick the subtree with the strongest priority
     elapsed timer
  3. Search that subtree for the highest priority item

Exelwtion time: O(lg N)
