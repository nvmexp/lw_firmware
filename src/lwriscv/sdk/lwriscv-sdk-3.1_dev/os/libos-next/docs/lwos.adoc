# LWOS 1.0

## Overview

LWOS aims to provide a high security and reliability kernel
through co-development of both the hardware and software stacks.

This document covers the high level proposal to support LWOS for
VGPU.

Trusted Isolation::
Two layers of protection for both spatial and temporal isolation.
Ensures isolation for branch predictor and cache.

High reliability::
Our core messaging and interrupts systems guarantee
message delivery -- no exceptions.

Intuitive::
Easily manage memory, tasks, and ports dynamically
at runtime.  Creating a partition or task is as simple
as running an ELF.

Provable Characteristics::
Our isolation kernel is provably free from runtime
errors.  We plan to expand our use of Ada/Spark
to the core kernel to ensure freedom from runtime
and memory errors.

Debuggable by Design::
We provide secure logging, call stacks with line numbers,
and soon task level debugging support.
Full support for ASAN and GDB debugging.

Predictable and fast performance::
Our core messaging and scheduling subsystems use
continuations to ensure maximum performance while
retaining predictability.

Scalable footprint::
Firmwares as small as 4kb with full task isolation
and asynchronous messaging.

### Terminology

LIBOS::
  A traditional micro-kernel responsible for task isolation, memory management,
  messaging, and interrupt delivery.

LWOS Partition::
  An instance of the paravirtualized LIBOS kernel.  One or more user tasks
  may be running.  Each partition has seperate device map, io-pmp, and pmp
  settings.

Device Map::
  The device map registers are designed to control the IO accesses to/from Peregrine when RISCV is running. Registers are grouped based on feature sets and each group is protected by a device map field. Device map is implemented at the master side of the control bus system. Please refer to MAS for detailed device map macro architecture.

IO-PMP::
  The IO-PMP controls the visibility of the Peregrine registers and memory to other engines on the chip.

PMP::
  The PMP controls the partitions access to Peregrine memory and apertures.

| Interrupt handling | Interrupts will be delivered to partition calling LibosInterruptAsyncRecv.  Intention is for GSP-RM task to receive all interrupts 
| Communication across partitions | The port API is fully functional across partition boundaries.  Port objects may be passed as part of a message across the partition boundary and will continue to function.
| Watchdog for partition scheduler | SK will switch to the LWOS Root partition when a partition exceeds it's timeslice.  This will result in reclaim and shutdown of the offending partition.  
| Tiny Profile | LWOS retains "Tiny" profile aimed at embedded firmware like FSP. No elf support, dynamic object creation, or transparent scheduling/messaging across partitions 
| Shared code  | Code for all tasks must be shareable across partition 
| Fast Async Interpartition Messaging | e.g. Transferrable pages for inter-partition messaging
|===

|===

## User-space APIs

### Filesystem

LWOS uses a simple read-only "root" filesystem.  The contents of this filesystem is mapped into all partitions.
The kernel(s) as well as all tasks are individual ELF files.

```
LibosStatus LibosElfOpen(
    const char      * elfName,
    LibosElfHandle  * handle
);
```

### Address Space

Tasks may have their own address spaces, or may share the same space.
These APIs are used to create the address space, map one or more elf files,
or directly map physical memory.

```
// Security: Any task
LibosStatus LibosAddressSpaceCreate(
    LibosAddressSpaceHandle * handle
);
```

```
// Security: Any task
LibosStatus LibosElfMap(LibosAddressSpaceHandle asid, LibosElfHandle elf, LwU64 * entry);
```

```
// Restricted: Init partition
LibosStatus LibosAddressSpaceMapPhysical(LibosAddressSpaceHandle asid, LwU64 va, LwU64 pa, LwU64 size, LwU64 flags);
```

FUTURE: Memory allocation API. Lwrrently heaps are expected to be declared as global variables in the .data section

### Partition

Partitions can be launched from user-space.  As each partition may have distinct device map and IO-PMP settings
the user is required to register the partition to get back a handle.

The LWOS root partition tracks the access controls to each partition.

```
// Restricted: Init partition
LibosStatus LibosPartitionRegister(LibosPartitionHandle * outPartition, LwU64 partitionId)
```

```
// Resets the partition to a non-running state with no assigned memory
// The LWOS root partition will selwrely scrub all allocated memory 
LibosStatus LibosPartitionReset(LibosPartitionHandle partition)

// Grants access to physical memory that the current partition has access to
// NOTE: This memory will not be scrubbed in the event the partition is killed
// Restricted: Init partition
LibosStatus LibosPartitionBindPhysical(LibosPartitionHandle partition, LwU64 physicalAddress, LwU64 size, LwU64 attributes);

// Note: The PartitionHandle is also a valid port, you must send a message to that port to start
//       exelwtion of this partition.  This is your chance to pass any port handles to use for
//       later Communication
LibosStatus LibosPartitionSpawn(LibosPartitionHandle partition, LibosElfHandle initTaskElf, LwU64 memorySize)
```

### Task 

Creates a new task in the current partition.

The task will be created in a waiting state.  Send a message to the LibosTaskHandle (it's a port)
to wake up the task.  The payload will become the first 8 arguments to the task entry point.
This is your opportunity to send any handles that will be required for future communication.

```
LibosStatus LibosTaskCreate(
    LibosTaskHandle *       outHandle,
    LibosPriority           priority, 
    LibosAddressSpaceHandle addressSpace, 
    LwU64                   entryPoint
);
```

### Messaging

Critical note: Lwrrently only port handles can be passed as part of a message.  This is due to complications with cross-partition messaging.

TBD: API for attaching handles to the shuttle before SendRecvAndWait

```
LibosStatus LibosShuttleCreate(
    LibosShuttleHandle * handle
);

LibosStatus LibosPortCreate(
    LibosPortHandle * handle
);
```

```
LibosStatus LibosPortSendRecvAndWait(
    // Send payload
    LibosShuttleHandle sendShuttle, 
    LibosPortHandle    sendPort,    
    void *     sendPayload,  
    LwU64              sendPayloadSize,

    // Recv payload
    LibosShuttleHandle recvShuttle,     
    LibosPortHandle    recvPort,        
    void *     recvPayload,     
    LwU64              recvPayloadSize, 

    // Wait
    LibosShuttleHandle  waitId,              
    LibosShuttleHandle *completedShuttle,    
    LwU64 *             completedSize,       

    LwU64               timeoutNs            
);

LibosStatus LibosPortSendAttachObject(
  LibosShuttleHandle  sendShuttle;
  LibosHandle         handle;
  LwU64               permissionGrant;
);

LibosStatus LibosPortRecvDetachObject(
  LibosShuttleHandle recvShuttle;
  LibosHandle      * localHandle;
  LwU64              permissionRequired;
);

```

### Locking

```
void LibosCriticalSectionEnter(LibosCriticalSectionBehavior behavior);
void LibosCriticalSectionLeave(void);
```

### Interrupts

Design change in progress.

Supervisor LWOS Root partition API will allow init task to designate a single
partition as the interrupt target.  On any interrupt, other LWOS partitions
will immediately yield back to the designated partition.

Future: User-space API to delegate these permissions should exist.



## Supervisor APIs

The LWOS root partition is responsible for selwrely handling:
 - Assignment of memory to partitions
 - Launching partitions
 - Partition reclaim and memory scrub
 - Watchdog timer

It is written in Ada/Spark against baremetal and retains mappings
to all memory owned by any running partitions.

### Interface

```
LwosRootInitPartition(LwU32 partitionId, LwU64 spawnGrantMask, LwU64 reclaimGrant)
LwosRootInitMemory(LwU64 base, LwU64 size);

LwosRootMemoryAllocate(LwU32 partitionOwner, LwU64 size) -> address

LwosRootPartitionPrepare(LwU32 partition)
LwosRootPartitionBindMemory(LwU64 base, LwU64 size, LwU64 attributes)
LwosRootPartitionBindFilesystem(LwU64 base, LwU64 size, LwU32 fileIndex)
LwosRootPartitionLaunch()

LwosRootGlobalPortAllocate()
LwosRootGlobalPortGrant(LwU32 port, LwU32 partitionId, PortGrantMask mask);
LwosRootGlobalPortRelease()

LwosRootPartitionReclaim(LwU32 partition)
LwosRootGlobalPageGet(LwU64 * base, LwU64 * size);
```

### Global page: Scheduler

These are not SBI's.  These are utility functions to work with the global page.

```
LwosRootSchedulerNextPartition()
LwosRootSchedulePartition(LwU32 newPriority)  // set to highest priority ready task

LwosRootPortNotifyRecv(LwU32 globalPort, LwU32 priority)
LwosRootPortCancelRecv(LwU32 globalPort)

LwosRootPortNotifySend(LwU32 globalPort, LwU32 priority)
LwosRootPortCancelSend(LwU32 globalPort)

LwosRootPortHasWaitingRecv(LwU32 globalPort)
LwosRootPortHasWaitingSend(LwU32 globalPort)
LwosRootPortSendToWaiter(LwU32 globalPort, void * buffer, LwU32 size) 
LwosRootPortRecvFromWaiter(LwU32 globalPort, void * buffer, LwU32 size)
```

### Global page: Interrupts

```
// Designates a partition as the interrupt target
LwosRootDesignateInterruptTarget(LwU64 partitionId);

// On interrupt, a partition should call this API to find
// the target partition (and immediately switch)
LwU64 LwosRootGetDesignatedInterruptTarget();
```

### Partition Entry Point

Each LIBOS enabled partition uses a0 as the reason for activation.
Upon first activation this partition records the calling partition
as the LIBOS Monitor partition.

During first launch, each partition will copy its data section into
the heap, and update the entry point to memoize this assignment.

[%header, cols="1,8"]
|===
| register | description                   
| a0 |  reason = LIBOS_PARTITION_CODE_BOOT 
| a1 |  memory start                       
| a2 |  memory size                        
| a3 |  filesystem start                   
| a4 |  filesystem offset for init task    
|===

## Straw-man

### Direct Transparent Messaging

Shadowing::
- Ports may be passed in a message across partition boundary
- Such ports are assigned a "global port" (managed by LWOS Root) 

Global Port::
 - Set of Senders
 - Set of Receivers
 - Set of Waiters and their task priorities
 - Bitmaps storing per-partition send/recv/wait permissions on this port
 - Stored in shared R/W memory

Algorithm::
 - Sending to a global port does nothing unless a paired sender/receiver is found
 - Round trip partition switch performed to exchange data at this point
 - Waiting partition scheduling priority updated based on awakened task priority
  
Limitations::
 - Global ports are a scarce resource 
 - Scheduling is co-operation through a shared page 
   [substancial provided by watchdog]

Algorithm. Send::
```python
  # No waiters? Mark ourselves as queued
  if not proxyPort.waitingRecv:
    proxyPort.waitingSend |= 1ULL << thisPartition
  else:
    # Tell target partition to copy data into recv buffer
    PartitionIpc(anyBit(proxyPort.waitingRecv), [
        :ActionSend,  # Target partition should switch back immediately
        proxyPort, 
        messageBody])
    
    CompleteSend()
```
   
Algorithm. Recv::
```python
  # No waiters? Mark ourselves as queued
  if not proxyPort.waitingSend:
    proxyPort.waitingRecv |= 1ULL << thisPartition
  else:
    # Tell target partition to give us the data
    message = PartitionIpc(anyBit(proxyPort.waitingRecv), [
        :ActionRecv,  # Target partition should switch back immediately
        proxyPort])

    # @note: SK must provide the calling partition in a register    
    CompleteRecv(message.sender, message.body)
```
   
### Transparent Global Scheduling

Algorithm::
 - Priority scheduler (32-bit priority)
 - Globally store per partition effective priority (highest priority of ready tasks)
 - Partition updates this value when yielding to another partition
 - Updated when message send/recv'd from global port (based on priority of waiter)
 - Switch to highest effective priority partition
 - Hysteresis timeslice for partition to avoid excessive switching

The global scheduler tracks the priority of the highest priority running task of the ready tasks in each partition. The partitions with the highest priority are then run in a round-robin fashion until their partition timeslice is exhausted.


Port-Wait/Port-Wait-Complete::
```
  // The PortWaitPriority table contains the priority of the highest
  // priority waiter at all times
  PortWaitPriority[port] = threadPriority(PortWaiters[port].head)
```

Port-Send/Port-Recv::
```
  if (port is remote)
  {
    // Update the partition priority
    PartitionPriority[remotePartition] = min(PartitionPriority[remotePartition], PortWaitPriority[port])

    // Should we partition switch
    if (PartitionPriority[remotePartition] < threadPriority)
      switchToPartition(remotePartition)
  }
```

### Watchdog

Under construction

## Future

### Kernel Tasks: Pre-emptable kernel

The kernel is entirely written in contination passing style.
Adding complex code like transparent management of separation kernel,
and restore DMA's real time properties requires pre-emptable kernel
tasks.

KernelSwitchToRpcThread::
 - Calls a LIBOS_NORETURN function passing all register
 - Function changes the task pointer in tp
 - Function resets the stack but leaves the registers intact
 - Kernel re-enables the interrupt bits
 - On return, the kernel restores the task pointer

Initially, we may reserve one kernel thread per user thread
to avoid blocking concerns and ensure simple and provable code.
Better performance may be achieved by implementing blocking
and re-using the most recent kernel thread.


## Internal Requirements

### Separation Kernel

- All supervisor interrupts routed to lwrrently running partition
- SK will provide a pool of 32-64 pre-baked partitions. Note that LWRTOS will be aware of partition id’s in the task creation call.
- SK will provide an SBI for the init partition to manage partition PMP entries. This is intended to be used for partition spawning and cleanup.
- SK will provide an SBI to change the partition entry point (required to locate .data section for partition from shared .code)
- SK will provide secure mechanism to identify calling partition
- LWRTOS will likely only use power-of-two PMP entries
- SBI management API only usable by the init partition
- Global page pool should have 128 entries
- Page size is power of 2
- Page allocation must not require partition switch
- Page transfer must not require partition switch
- Page transfer must succeed even if target partition PMP table is full
- Page map must succeed  even if local partition PMP table is full

### Inter-partition messaging convention

LWRTOS will use a single shared 64kb page for inter-task communication.
This enables LWRTOS to forward synchronous port calls across partition
boundaries with good performance. 

```
def KernelPartitionSendSynchronous(target, buffer, size):
   # Copy payload to global page (callee clears)
   Copy(globalPage, buffer, size)

   # Immediately switch to target partition
   # Callee scrubs the buffer
   PartitionSwitch(target)
```

 - All supervisor interrupts routed to lwrrently running partition
 - SK will provide a pool of 32-64 pre-baked partitions.
   Note that LWRTOS will be aware of partition id's in
   the task creation call.
 - SK will provide an SBI for the init partition to manage
   partition PMP entries. This is intended to be used for
   partition spawning and cleanup.
 - SK will provide an SBI to change the partition entry point
   (required to locate .data section for partition from shared .code)
 - SK will provide secure mechanism to identify calling partition
 - LWRTOS will likely only use power-of-two PMP entries

###  Performance Requirements

Asynchronous messaging performance is important for handling interrupts.
A single global messaging page leads to a 3x increase in expensive partition
switch calls. The solution is a pool of pages that any partition can allocate,
fill, and transfer to other partitions.

- Page allocation must not require partition switch
- Page transfer must not require partition switch
- Page transfer must succeed even if target partition PMP table is full

These requirements suggest that we need a level of indirection between
memory ownership validation and PMP entries.

One possible implementation::
- Fixed length global table of FB buffers in SK
- Each buffer has a single owner, or no owner
- Transfer() - Changes ownership of a buffer. Validates no mappings exist. Validates we own the buffer, or no one owns the buffer.
- Map() - Maps the buffer into the current partition
  (provided it has been unmapped)


## Development Roadmap

New Work::
  Enhanced Isolation, Dynamic Tasks/Ports

Leverages GSP-RM Development::
  KASAN, SSP, Performance tuning, GDB support (forthcoming), Soft-TLB 

Leverage FSP Development::
  Drivers, New Scheduler, Investment in Ada Spark
