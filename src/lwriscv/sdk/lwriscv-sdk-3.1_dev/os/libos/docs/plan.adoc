- Syscalls 2.0
  Marks port/dma sections of kernel as "core".
  Code is core kernel was implemented using continuations for real time reasons.

  All other code is now interruptable and schedulable.  This allows implementing the
  port proxy for remote partitions in the kernel in a straightforward fashion

## Port Proxy

## Syscalls 2.0

Once in the kernel, most syscalls should be implemented by dropping 
down to a kernel task.  

Requirements::
 - Each task should have a designated kernel task if
   we need to avoid blocking. Suggest storing pointer in Task struct.
 - Should be diffilwlt to add new syscalls that don't drop into 
   a kernel Task
 - The "light" profile should not implement this mechanism 
   to keep size down
 - If the kernel thread is quiscient we should not fall into the port code
   beyond inheriting the registers.  
 - Blocking syscalls must follow a strict convention of inputs and outputs
   being in adjacent blocks of registers (per RISC-V numbering) to allow
   passing the register context area as port arguments
 - Consider macro generated sycall
    SYSCALL_SCHEDULED(enum-name, targetFunction, inputs, outputs)
    inputs is number of registers from a0 as input
    outputs is TBD
    This macro has different implementations on context and is used to generate
    the enums, the dispatch table (in kernel-data.ld), as well as the tables
    for input/output counts

```
    if (task->syscallTask is ready)
    {
        mv tp, &task->syscallTask
        mv sp, task->syscallTask.Stack
        jal ra, syscallImplementation

        // Restore tp and return to task

    }
    else
    {
        // send a blocking port send/recv from the user task to the kernel task
        // (since it's busy) and have it copy directly into the register area
        // @note: We'll need a data structure to encode the payload size
        port-send-recv(&task->context->registers[RISCV_A0], ...);
    }
```
