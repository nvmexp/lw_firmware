= LIBOS: Tiny Profile

:toc:

== Overview

The tiny profile of LIBOS provides basic scheduling, memory isolation, full IPC, and
basic drivers in just ~4kb of code.  This makes it ideal for firmware with limited
access to external memory.

Features Includes::
 - Microkernel architecture
 - Preemptive scheduler
 - Interrupt support
 - Full synchronous/asynchronous IPC
 - Flexible memory isolation
 - User trap handlers
 - Basic drivers [e.g DMA]
 - Rich libraries including compliant printf() and malloc()

=== Static Resource Management

The tiny profile of LIBOS is designed to run with a static set of resources
(e.g ports/tasks/ports) at runtime.  These resources are declared with
macros and are initialized at compile time.

No code for the creation of shuttles, ports, or tasks exists at runtime.

=== Memory Management

Memory is directly managed by the user-written init task.
The user makes calls to LibosBootstrapMmap to program MPU entries.

Each task is statically assigned a set of MPU entries at compile time
that will be enabled while that task is running.  The same MPU entries
may be valid in multiple tasks simultaneously.

Demand faulting of MPU entries is not supported on LIBOS Tiny Profile
(see LIBOS_FEATURE_PAGING)

@note: The full profile includes a paging task that is responsible
       for memory management.  This environment includes provisions
       for allocation and mapping of arbitrary virtual memory allocations.
       This includes emulating a hashed page table through the MPU.

=== Boot flow

@note Under construction.

The kernel entry point is kernel/bootstrap.c (@see KernelBootstrap).

This function assumes that the phdr_text section of the ELF has been
placed at offset IMEM_FIRST in IMEM, and the phdr_data section has been
placed at DMEM_FIRST.

Once the MPU has been configured the kernel starts exelwtion at
KernelInit and quickly tranfers control to the user written init task.

The init task runs in user-mode but has priveleged access to a number of
APIs for MPU and task management.  This task is responsible for waking up
the other tasks and handling crashing remote tasks.

Tasks are generally declared as waiting on a specific port for a message.
Sending a message from the init task to the designated port will start
exelwtion of the task.  Only the init task may be running at init.

When a task takes a fault, it will be reported to the init task as a messages
to the trap port.  The message contents includes the register state for the
task.  The init task may reply with a new register state to continue exelwtion.
This is intended for use by debuggers.

Task reset is not lwrrently supported in the Libos tiny profile.

=== Security

Tasks/Shuttles/Ports locked at runtime::
The task, shuttle, and port objects are initialized at compile time.
The manifest compiler is responsible for statically constructing the
resource hash tables.

Full task isolation::
Tasks have no access to kernel data structures nor to other tasks.

Minimal kernel interface::
The kernel supports port messaging, and critical drivers such as DMA.
All APIs are validated to ensure the caller cannot escalate priveleges.

=== Ports & Shuttles

Ports are the ultimate target of all send/receives.
Shuttles track the status of the individual send or receive call.  They can be used to wait for the completion or cancel and outstanding transaction.
The buffer is copied directly between tasks on completion of the messaging call.  There is no limit to the number of messages, or size of the messages pending on a port.

image::rpc1.png[rpc1.png]

Ports:: Target of send/receive
Shuttle:: Tracks status pending send/receive
Buffer:: Copied once both the receiver and sender are ready.

All operations complete or fail atomically.

=== Directory Structure

libos/kernel::
  The core micro-kernel sources. This code should not require modification.
  bootstrap.c contains the entry point for the kernel.

libos/libs::
  User-space libraries for time, ports, dma, printf, rbtree and malloc.

libos/manifest-compiler::
  Processes manifest and produces the final task, port, and shuttle
  tables. This allows the elimination of complex and large initialization code.

libos/profiles::
  Each configuration includes header locations, enabled kernel
  features, SK partition config [MPU and TCM available], and so on

libos/simulator::
libos/tests::
  Standalone verification tests for kernel.

== Configuration

The build scripts expected PEREGRINE_PROFILE to be set to the subdirectory in libos/profiles
containing config.mk. This file is included directly in the makefile fragments as well as
preprocessed into libos-config.h for consumption by the libraries, kernel, and user code.

=== libosDmaWait

Waits for all previously committed DMA operations to complete.

Does not issue a memory barrier to ensure writes to FB/SYSCOH have
reached a point of coherence.

----
void libosDmaWait(void);
----

== Balanced Tree API

LIBOS contains a well tested routines for re-balancing of red-black binary trees.
You may construct a simple red-black tree by copying the template below.

=== Example

[source,C]
----

typedef LibosTreeHeader IntegerMap; 

typedef struct {
    LibosTreeHeader header;
    LwU64           key;
    LwU64           value;
} IntegerMapNode;

void IntegerMapConstruct(IntegerMap * integerMap) 
{
    LibosTreeConstruct(integerMap);
}

void IntegerMapInsert(IntegerMap * integerMap, IntegerMapNode * node)
{
    LibosTreeHeader * * slot = &integerMap->parent;
    node->header.parent = node->header.left = node->header.right = integerMap;
    while (!(*slot)->isNil)
    {
        node->header.parent = *slot;
        if (CONTAINER_OF(node, IntegerMapNode, header)->key < 
              CONTAINER_OF(*slot, IntegerMapNode, header)->key)
            slot = &(*slot)->left;
        else
            slot = &(*slot)->right;
    }
    *slot = &node->header;

    LibosTreeInsertFixup(&node->header, 0);
}

void IntegerMapUnlink(IntegerMapNode * node)
{
    LibosTreeUnlink(&node->header, 0);
}

IntegerMapNode * IntegerMapFind(IntegerMap * integerMap, LwU64 key)
{
    LibosTreeHeader * i = integerMap->parent;

    while (!i->isNil)
        if (key < CONTAINER_OF(i, IntegerMapNode, header)->key)
            i = i->left;
        else if (key > CONTAINER_OF(i, IntegerMapNode, header)->key)
            i = i->right;
        else
            return CONTAINER_OF(i, IntegerMapNode, header);

    return 0;
}

=== Theory

The header node acts like a link node in a cirlwlar link list.
It simplifies traveral, and enables removing nodes without having an explicit root
pointer.  

header->parent:: Points to the root of the binary tree.
header->left:: Points to the left child, or the header node if there is no left child.
header->right:: Points to the right child, or the header node if there is no left child.

The header node is the only node with 'isNil' set to true.

=== LibosTreeConstruct

Initializes the header node of a red-black tree.  
This node acts like the header-link in a double linked list.

[source,C]
----
void LibosTreeConstruct(LibosTreeHeader *header);
----

=== LibosTreeInsertFixup

Performs the red-black tree rebalance after inserting
a new node into a tree. 

Requirements::
  - x->left and x->right must be set to the header node
  - x->parent must properly set to the parent

[source,C]
----
void LibosTreeInsertFixup(LibosTreeHeader *x);
----

=== LibosTreeUnlink

Removes a node from a red-black tree and Performs
any required unbalancing.

[source,C]
----
void LibosTreeUnlink(LibosTreeHeader *);
----

== libriscv: RISC-V instruction decoder

General purposes library for decompiling RISC-V instructions.
This is used internally by the simulator and task level debugging.

=== libosRiscvDecode

Decodes a single RISC-V instruction. 

Callers must provide a full 32-bit opcode value starting at the IP address.
This may not be aligned due to compressed ISA. The routine will return the
address of the next instruction.

[source,C]
----
typedef struct {
  LibosRiscvOpcode    opcode;
  LibosRiscvRegister  rs1, rs2, rd;
  LwU64               imm;
  LwU64               csr;
} LibosRiscvInstruction;

LwU64 libosRiscvDecode(LwU32 opcode, LwU64 programCounter, LibosRiscvInstruction * instr);
----

=== libosRiscvPrint

[source,C]
----
void libosRiscvPrint(LwU64 pc, LibosRiscvInstruction * i)
